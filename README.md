## About

The software is to act as sort-of a band-aid until Skyline supports Updates/DLCs natively.

> **Note:** doesn't support DLCs yet.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nozwock/havocr1/tnus/releases).

### Supported File Types
- [x] NSP 
- [ ] XCI
- [ ] NSZ

> **Note:** Support for others might be added.
